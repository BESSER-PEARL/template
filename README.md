# GitHub Best Practices Template

This is **template repository** for helping others to follow the best practices when developing GitHub projects.

You will find a collection of files and configuration recommendations for kick-starting a new project in GitHub. 

## ‚öíÔ∏è Using this template for your project

To use this template, you can create a new repository by clicking on _Use this template_ button. 

The new repository will use this one as a template, meaning that it will contain all files. 
Once the new repository is created, you can edit its files to adapt them to your needs.

## üí° Best Practices

In the following, we cover the main element you should configure to prepare your project. 

### üßæ Project description

The project description is a short text which tells community about your work. 

You can edit the project description in the `About` tab of the repository (click on the gear icon on the top right). Create a descriptive entry for the project, and include at least three tags. If the project has a website, indicate also the URL.

Finally, decide whether your repository page should include `Releases`, `Packages` or `Environments` tabs. In case of doubt, remove them. You can find more information about [Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository), [Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) and [Enviroments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) in the official GitHub documentation.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Contributing guidelines

Contributing guidelines describe how people can help on the development of your project. Is the project developed by a single contributor? Can anyone jump in and help on the development? How to send contributions? 

Contributing guidelines are generally provided in the well-known file `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

This template includes a proposal for `CONTIBUTING.md`. Please, read carefully the provided template and adapt to your needs.

### üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Code of conduct

The Code of conduct of your project establishes the set of behavioral rules for the community. How harrasment cases will be resolved? To whom you have to contact if you feel attacked? 

Code of conduct is usually defined in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file.

This template includes a proposal for `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Please, read carefully the provided template and adapt to your repository.

### üèõÔ∏è Governance

Governance rules define the set of norms which are applied to make decisions in your project, and your community. One the one hand, governance project rules address questions such as: who will accept my pull request? or how much time it will take to be accepted? On the other hand, governance community rules cover questions such as: who will accept me as part of the project leaders? 

The explicit definition of governance rules is not a trivial task, but when done, it is usually defined in the `GOVERNANCE.md` file.

This template includes a proposal for `GOVERNANCE.md`. Please, read carefully the provided template and adapt to your repository.

### üñäÔ∏è Templates

GitHub supports the definition of templates for the issues and pull requests in the project. This help your community to better fill in these elements.

This project proposes templates for issues and pull requests. You can find them in the `.github` folder. 

* Issue templates are located in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`. You can find a template for proposals and questions, but you can modify or create new ones. You can find more information in [About issue and pull request templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates). 

* Pull request template is located in `.github`. You can find more information in [About issue and pull request templates](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

If you do not plan to use these templates, remove the folder. 

### ‚öñÔ∏è License

The license sets the legal framework for your project. 

In this template we have started by the CC-BY-SA license, but you can change it to any other license. You can find a list of licenses in [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/).

### üìì Citation

If your work is related to a paper, and you want to facilitate its citation, review the `CITATION.cff` file. 

The provided template will help to fill the gaps, but if you need more help, you can find more information in [Citation File Format](https://citation-file-format.github.io/). Otherwise, just remove the file.
